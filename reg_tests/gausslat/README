Regression test for iplib routine gausslat.  Routine is called 
from a simple Fortran program to calculate the gaussian
latitudes for a t382 grid.  

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control' 
and 'test' iplibs by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the /reg_tests directory.  See the 
/reg_tests/README file for more information.  

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The Fortran source code and make-related files are
located in the ./src subdirectory.  The executables (a 
total of six) are stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script 
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the Runall.${machine}.ksh driver script located 
in /reg_tests.

All output is written to a text file.  If the files from the
'control' and 'test' iplibs are different, the regression
test is considered failed.
