Regression test for iplib routine ipmerge2, which merges two bitmapped
fields into one.  I am not sure this routine is even used anymore.
This routine is called from a simple Fortran program.

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control'
and 'test' iplibs by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the /reg_tests directory.  See the
/reg_tests/README file for more information.

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float  
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float 
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer 

The Fortran source code and make-related files are 
located in the ./src subdirectory.   The executables (a 
total of six) are stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the Runall.${machine}.ksh driver script located
in /reg_tests.

All output is written to a text file.  If the
text files from the 'control' and 'test' iplibs are not identical,
the regression test is considered failed.
