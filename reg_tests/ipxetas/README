Regression test for routine ipxetas.  A Fortran program 
reads an input file of vegetation greenness on a 'full'
(or 'filled') 12km eta grid.  Then calls ipxetas to:

 1) create a staggered mass grid from the full grid.
 2) create a staggered velocity grid from the full grid.
 3) create a full grid from the staggered mass grid created by step (1)
 4) create a full grid from the staggered vel grid created by step (2)

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control'
and 'test' iplibs by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the /reg_tests directory.  See the
/reg_tests/README file for more information.

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The Fortran source code and make-related files are
located in the ./sorc subdirectory.  The executables are
(a total of six) stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

The input greenness data is ./data/green.202.grb
It is in grib 1 format.

Output from the program is written to binary files.
(Steps 1 and 2 written to "staggered.bin", and steps 3 and 4 written
to "full.bin").  These files may be viewed in Grads
with the ".ctl" files, located in the ./grads subdirectory.

The routine also outputs a kgds array used by the grib 1 (w3nco)
library.  The contents of the kgds array are output to a text
log file.  

The binary and log files from the 'control' and 'test' ip libraries
are expected to be bit identical for the regression test to pass.

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the Runall.${machine}.ksh driver script located
in /reg_tests.
