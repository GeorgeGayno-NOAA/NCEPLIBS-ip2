Regression test for gdswzd and all of its child routines.
Calculate lat/lon and other map-related fields for several
grids of various map projections using a Fortran program.

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control' and
'test' iplibs by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the /reg_tests directory.  See the /reg_tests/README
file for more information.  

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The Fortran source code and make-related files are located in 
the ./sorc subdirectory. The executables (a total of six) are stored in
the ./exec subdirectory.

The regression test is run by the runall.ksh script
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the Runall.${machine}.ksh driver script located
in /reg_tests.  

The following grids are tested:

grid #       description
======       ===========
003          one-degree global lat/lon (ncep grid 3)
008          mercator (ncep grid 8)
127          t254 gaussian (ncep grid 127)
203h         rotated lat/lon e-staggered (number meaningless).
             this is the old 12km eta grid - 'h' points
203v         rotated lat/lon e-staggered (number meaningless).
             this is the old 12km eta grid - 'v' points
205h         rotated lat/lon b-staggered (number meaningless).
             this is the 12km nam grid - 'h' points
205v         rotated lat/lon b-staggered (number meaningless).
             this is the 12km nam grid - 'v' points
212          nh polar stereographic, spherical earth (number meaningless)
213          sh polar stereographic, spherical earth (number meaningless)
218          lambert conformal (ncep grid 218)
222          nh polar stereographic, elliptical earth (number meaningless)

The gdswzd routines compute the following fields:

- lat/lon from i/j OR i/j from lat lon
- clockwise vector rotation sines/cosines
- dx/dlon, dx/dlat, dy/dlon, dy/dlat
- grid box area

The routines are called twice for each grid to test both the
i/j to lat/lon AND lat/lon to i/j transforms.  This is controled by setting 
the routines' IOPT argument to '0'/'-1'.  The transform should be reversable to 
within floating point differences.  If it is not reversable a warning
message is printed to standard output and the regression test
is considered failed.

All fields computed from each call to gdswzd are output to a binary file.
The files from the 'control' and 'test' ip libraries are compared 
and if not bit identical, the test fails.  These binary files may be visualized in
GRADS using the control files in the ./grads subdirectory.
