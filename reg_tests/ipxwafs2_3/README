Test ip routines ipxwafs2 and ipxwafs3 by transforming a global grid of
600 mb temperature (on ncep grid 3) to wafs grids 37 thru 44 using copygb.
A similar transform is done by gfs job exgfs_grib_wafs.sh.ecf

After the global to wafs grid transforms are completed, copygb is
invoked again to interpolate files of 600 mb temperature on each wafs grid
back to ncep grid 3.

This regression test uses the copygb source code that is part of the 
copygb regression test.  That code is compiled with all byte versions
of the 'control' and 'test' ip libraries:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer
The source code and executables (a total of six) are in the 
copygb/sorc and exec directories. See /copygb/README for details.

The input data for these tests is located in the ./data subdirectory.
They are in grib 1 format:
  grid.3.grb             (600 mb temps on ncep grib 3)
  wafs.${wafs_grib}.grb  (600 mb temps on each wafs grid)

Note: Routine ipxwafs2 is invoked for interpolation option '0' (bilinear)
and routine ipxwafs3 is invoked for interpolation option '2' (neighbor)
Also, routine ipxwafs is invoked as well.  However, only part of the
routine is used, so a separate regression test for ipxwafs is
required.

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the Runall.${machine}.ksh driver script located
in /reg_tests.

All output from copygb is in grib 1.  If the grib 1 files from the
'control' and 'test' libraries are not bit identical, the 
regression test is considered failed.
