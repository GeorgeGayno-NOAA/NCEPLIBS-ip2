Regression test for ncep copygb program.

Invoke copygb to interpolate a global lat/lon grid of vegetation
greenness or albedo to numerous ncep standard grids.  Use all interpolation
options: 0-bilinear, 1-bicubic, 2-neighbor, 3-budget, 4-spectral,
6-neighbor-budget.

The ncep standard grid numbers are defined in the official
ncep grib 1 documentation. Not all standard grids are tested.
For example, there is an error with how w3nco routine w3fi71
specifies the GDS for NCEP grid 174.  This causes copygb to
fail on Zeus. Also grids 90, 91 and 92 are very high-res, which
will cause copygb to run very slow, especially for the spectral
interpolation.  Running the spectral test just for grid 90
took 44 minutes on Zeus.
 
The input greenness data is: $NWPROD/global_shdmax.0.144x0.144.grb
The input albedo data is: $NWPROD/global_snoalb.1x1.grb
The lower res albedo data is only used for the spectral interpolation
(which is computationally intensive).  On CCS/WCOSS, NWPROD=/nwprod/fix.
On Zeus, NWPROD is the following gfs subversion tag:
/NCEPDEV/global/save/glopara/svn/gfs/tags/REL-9.1.3/para/fix/fix_am

The copygb source code and make-related files are 
located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control' and 'test' 
iplibs by invoking the make_reg_test.ksh script located
in the /reg_tests directory.  See the /reg_tests/README
file for more information before compiling.  

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The executables (a total of six) are stored in the 
./exec subdirectory.

The regression test is run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the proper driver script in the ./scripts subdirectory as follows:

"llsubmit run_ccs.ksh" (ccs machine)
"bsub < run_wcoss.ksh" (wcoss machine)
"qsub run_zeus.ksh"    (zeus machine)

These driver scripts call the copygb.ksh script located in ./scripts.

The interpolated greenness or albedo is output in grib 1 format.
If the grib 1 files from the 'control' and 'test' iplibs is
not bit identical, the regression test is considered failed.

This is considered a 'supplemental' regression test and it is NOT
run as part of the full suite of tests from the Runall.${machine}.ksh
driver in the ./reg_tests directory.

NOTE, the copygb executable in this directory is used as part of
the ipxwafs2_3 regression test.
