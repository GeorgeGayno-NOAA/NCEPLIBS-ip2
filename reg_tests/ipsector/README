Test iplib routines ipsector, which creates a subsector of a 
larger two-dimensional field, and routine ipspaste, which
does the opposite.  Test is performed with a Fortran program.

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control'
and 'test' iplibs by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the /reg_tests directory.  See the
/reg_tests/README file for more information.

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The Fortran source code and make-related files are
located in the ./src subdirectory.  The executables (a
total of six) are stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

Test specifics: read in a global dataset of substrate
temperature, then call ipsector to create a subsector of
the original grid.  Then call ipspaste to 'paste'
the subsectored data (created by call to ipsector) back
to the original grid.  The data returned from ipspaste
should match the original data.

Three sets of calls to ipsector/ipspaste are made:
- for a North America subsector
- for a non-overlapping subsector
- for an overlapping subsector

The routines have differing logic for different Grib 1 scan
modes.  So there are two input files of global substrate
temperature - one for scan mode '0' and one for scan mode '32'.
Both datasets are located in the ./data subdirectory.

Output from each step is written to binary files.  These file
may be viewed in Grads using the control files in the ./grads subdirectory.

The regression test fails if the 'control' and 'test' subsectored
data is not bit identical, or if the 'test' data from the
ipspaste step does not match the original data.

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the Runall.${machine}.ksh driver script located
in /reg_tests.
