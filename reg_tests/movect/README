Regression test for iplib routine movect, which moves a
vector along a great circle route.  The routine is 
invoked from a Fortran program.

The Fortran program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control'
and 'test' iplibs by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the /reg_tests directory.  See the 
/reg_test/README file for more information.  

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The Fortran source code and make-related files are 
located in the ./src subdirectory.  Program executables (a total
of six) are stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script in the
the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script is run
by the /reg_tests/Runall.${machine}.ksh driver script.

All output is written to a text file.  If the files from the
'control' and 'test' iplibs are different, the regression
test is considered failed.
