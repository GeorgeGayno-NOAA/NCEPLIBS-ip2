Regression test for iplib routine makgds using a simple Fortran
program.

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control'
and 'test' iplibs by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the /reg_tests directory.  See the
/reg_tests/README file for more information.

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The Fortran source code and make-related files are
located in the ./src subdirectory.  The executables (a
total of six) are stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

Routine makgds is tested as follows:
  1) Create gds and kgds arrays for ncep grid 3.  Arrays hold grid
     description information used by the w3nco grib library.
  2) Make kgds array for grid 3 from gds array
  3) Make gds array for grid 3 from kgds array

All output is written to a text file.  If the files from the
'control' and 'test' iplibs are different, the regression
test is considered failed.

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the Runall.${machine}.ksh driver script located
in /reg_tests.
