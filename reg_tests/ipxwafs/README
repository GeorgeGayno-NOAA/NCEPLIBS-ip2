Test ip routine ipxwafs by transforming a global grid of
600 mb temperature (on ncep grid 3) to wafs grids 37 thru 44 using a 
specially modified version of copygb.

After the global to wafs grid transforms are completed, copygb is
invoked again to interpolate a grid of 600 mb temperature on each 
wafs grid back to ncep grid 3.

The special copygb source code and the make-related files 
are in the ./sorc subdirectory.  The code is compiled with all
byte versions of the 'control' and 'test' ip libraries:

  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

To compile, invoke the make_reg_tests.ksh script located
in the /reg_tests directory.  See the /reg_tests/README
file for more information.  The executables (a total
of six) are stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

These input datasets (field of 600 mb temperature), are located
in the ./data subdirectory of THE IPXWAFS2_3 REGRESSION test.
They are in grib 1 format:
  grid.3.grb             (600 mb temps on ncep grib 3)
  wafs.${wafs_grib}.grb  (600 mb temps on each wafs grid)

Note: routine ipxwafs and ipxwafs2 are the same except the latter
accounts for bitmaps.  The ops version of copygb uses the latter
routine for all interpolation options except '2' (neighbor).
The specially modified version calls ipxwafs instead.  Since the
test datasets do not have bitmaps (a field of 600 mb temperatures)
the specially modified copygb and ops copygb give the same answer.

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the Runall.${machine}.ksh driver script located
in /reg_tests.

All output from copygb is in grib 1.  If the grib 1 files from the
'control' and 'test' libraries are not bit identical, the
regression test is considered failed.
